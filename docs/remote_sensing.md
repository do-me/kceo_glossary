# Remote Sensing (or Remote Observation)

## 1 Definition

Remote sensing is a type of [Observation](../observation) performed at a significant distance from a [Phenomenon](../phenomenon).

### Notes 
- ‘Significant’ in this context means that the distance has, or may have, a non-negligible impact on the value of the [Property](../property) observed.
- The effect of the distance on the acquired data is the main distinction criterion between ‘remote’ and ‘in-situ’ observations.
