# Location

## 1 Definition 

Particular [Place](../place) referenced by an identifier.

### Notes 
- While a (geo)location identifies a geographic [Place](../place), it may also be associated with objects other than the Earth.
- While location in principle covers 0- to 3-dimensional spatial geometries, it should not be used for 0- and 1-dimensional geometries (positions and paths)

### Examples 
- Madrid 
- California
