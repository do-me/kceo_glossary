# Auxiliary Data

## 1 Definition

Data, which enhance processing, and utilization of main sensor data. The auxiliary data are usually not captured by the same data collection process or on the same platform as the main sensor data. Examples are e.g. meteorological data received from ECWMF/Met or DEMs. Offices. Auxiliary data help in data processing, but are also data sets in their own right.

EnMAP: (a) Orbit files, attitude files, calibration data, instrument house-keeping data, (b) atmospheric parameters, reference images.
