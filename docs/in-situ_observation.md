# In-Situ Observation

## 1 Definition 

‘In-situ’ describes observations performed in the same [Place](../place) where a [Phenomenon](../phenomenon) occurs, normally without isolating it from other systems (its environment) or altering its pre-[Observation](../observation) state. The main [Characteristic](../characteristic) of such observations is that distance has no or only negligible (within [Uncertainty](../uncertainty)) influence on the [Value](../value) of the [Property](../property) observed. In-situ observations therefore often require either direct physical contact or small distances between a [Sensor](../sensor) and the observed [Phenomenon](../phenomenon).
