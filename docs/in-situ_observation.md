# In-Situ Observation

## 1 Definition 

‘In-situ’ describes observations performed in the same place where a phenomenon occurs, normally without isolating it from other systems (its environment) or altering its pre-[Observation](../Observation) state. The main characteristic of such observations is that distance has no or only negligible (within [Uncertainty](../Uncertainty)) influence on the value of the property observed. In-situ observations therefore often require either direct physical contact or small distances between a sensor and the observed phenomenon. 

### Notes 
- Observations not fulfilling these conditions are considered Remote Sensing
