# Uncertainty

## 1 Definition

A parameter, associated with the result of a [Measurement](../measurement), that characterises the dispersion of the values that could reasonably be attributed to the [Measurand](../measurand).

## 2 Definition

Non-negative parameter, associated with [Data](../data), which characterizes the dispersion of the values [of a [Trait](../trait) ]that could reasonably be attributed to a [Phenomenon](../phenomenon) [by means of sensing or modelling].

### Notes 
- In case of quantitative(continuous) [Data](../data) the uncertainty may be, for example, a standard deviation (or a given multiple of it), or the half-width of an interval having a stated level of confidence. (see e.g. standard and [Expanded Uncertainty](../expanded uncertainty))
- For qualitative (categorical?) [Data](../data) uncertainty may be, for example, expressed by commission and omission (‘confusion matrix’) or overall errors.

## 4 Definition

Parameter, associated with the result of [Measurement](../measurement), that characterizes the dispersion of values that could reasonably be attributed to the [Measurand](../measurand).

### Notes 
- When the quality of accuracy or precision of measured values, such as coordinates, is to be characterized quantitatively, the quality parameter is an estimate of the uncertainty of the [Measurement](../measurement) results. Because accuracy is a qualitative concept, one should not use it quantitatively, that is associate numbers with it; numbers should be associated with measures of uncertainty instead.

## 5 Definition

Parameter characterizing the dispersion of the values being attributed to a [Measurand](../measurand), based on the [Information](../information) used.
