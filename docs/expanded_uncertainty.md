# Expanded Uncertainty

## 1 Definition

Expanded [Uncertainty](../uncertainty) is the standard [Uncertainty](../uncertainty) multiplied by a coverage factor, k. The coverage factor is chosen to obtain a desired level of confidence. Most commonly a 95% [Confidence interval](../confidence interval) is chosen. For a Gaussian distribution, this is achieved with a coverage factor k = 2. (Note that strictly this provides a 95.45% [Confidence interval](../confidence interval)).
