# Calibration

## 1 Definition

Calibration refers to the process of quantitatively defining a system’s (e.g. a [Sensor](../sensor) or [Model](../model)’s) response to known, controlled inputs produced for example by references. In Remote Sensing, it implies the collection of pre-flight and in-flight calibration measurements and in-situ [Data](../data) that is to be used in the [Data](../data) calibration processing routine.
