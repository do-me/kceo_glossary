# Calibration

## 1 Definition

Calibration refers to the process of quantitatively defining a system’s (e.g. a sensor or model’s) response to known, controlled inputs produced for example by references. In Remote Sensing, it implies the collection of pre-flight and in-flight calibration measurements and in-situ data that is to be used in the data calibration processing routine.
