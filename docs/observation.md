# Observation

## 1 Definition 

Observation (the process) is the act of determining the value of property by interacting with the phenomenon using a sensor. The obtained values are factual?( objective?, observational?) data and are often themselves refeered to as observations (the results of the process).

### Notes 
- the observed value is usually complemented by an [Uncertainty](../Uncertainty)
- an observation (results) represents a sample of phenomenon (otherwise it would be identical with the phenomenon)
