# Observation

## 1 Definition 

Observation (the process) is the act of determining the value of [Property](../property) by interacting with the [Phenomenon](../phenomenon) using a [Sensor](../sensor). The obtained values are factual?( objective?, observational?) data and are often themselves refeered to as observations (the results of the process).

### Notes 
- the observed value is usually complemented by an [Uncertainty](../uncertainty)
- an observation (results) represents a [Sample](../sample) of [Phenomenon](../phenomenon) (otherwise it would be identical with the [Phenomenon](../phenomenon))
