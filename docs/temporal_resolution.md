# Temporal Resolution

## 1 Definition

The [Observation](../observation) or [Model](../model) output representing regular intervals and specifying the length of the interval that determines the smallest event or process that can be resolved (e.g., the [Period](../period) between observations, the time steps in a [Model](../model)).

### Notes 

- WIGOS 2019 distinguishes between sampling time [Period](../period), as the [Period](../period) over which a [Measurement](../measurement) is taken, and temporal sampling interval as the time [Period](../period) between the beginning of consecutive sampling periods. Temporal resolution in this Glossary is equivalent to sampling time [Period](../period) as used by WIGOS.
