# Geocoding

## 1 Definition

Translation of one form of location into another.

### Notes 
- Geocoding usually refers to the translation of "address" or "intersection" to "direct position." Many services providers also include a "reverse geocoding" interface to their geocoder, thus extending the definition of the service as a general translator of location. Because routing services use internal location encodings not usually available to others, a geocoder is an integral part of the internals of such a service.
