# Geocoding

## 1 Definition

Translation of one form of [Location](../location) into another.

### Notes 
- Geocoding usually refers to the translation of "address" or "intersection" to "direct [Position](../position)." Many services providers also include a "reverse geocoding" interface to their geocoder, thus extending the definition of the service as a general translator of [Location](../location). Because routing services use internal [Location](../location) encodings not usually available to others, a geocoder is an integral part of the internals of such a service.
